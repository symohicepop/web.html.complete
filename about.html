Our Vision
Our vision is to empower local youth to tap into the myriad opportunities that the mobile, technology and software
development industry offers so that they can innovate, create and improve their situation in life through use of digital tools.

Given predictions that the digital economy will continue to grow exponentially throughout Africa, we are a catalyst to
enable Africans from all walks of life to benefit from this social/economic revolutionâ€”not just in greater access of
information, but also in leading design and content development. We hope our efforts will stimulate economic growth and
empower African youth.
